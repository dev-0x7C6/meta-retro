# /* Abstracts the concept of a pointing mechanism, e.g. touch.
#  * This allows libretro to query in absolute coordinates where on the
#  * screen a mouse (or something similar) is being placed.
#  * For a touch centric device, coordinates reported are the coordinates
#  * of the press.
#  *
#  * Coordinates in X and Y are reported as:
#  * [-0x7fff, 0x7fff]: -0x7fff corresponds to the far left/top of the screen,
#  * and 0x7fff corresponds to the far right/bottom of the screen.
#  * The "screen" is here defined as area that is passed to the frontend and
#  * later displayed on the monitor.
#  *
#  * The frontend is free to scale/resize this screen as it sees fit, however,
#  * (X, Y) = (-0x7fff, -0x7fff) will correspond to the top-left pixel of the
#  * game image, etc.
#  *
#  * To check if the pointer coordinates are valid (e.g. a touch display
#  * actually being touched), PRESSED returns 1 or 0.
#  *
#  * If using a mouse on a desktop, PRESSED will usually correspond to the
#  * left mouse button, but this is a frontend decision.
#  * PRESSED will only return 1 if the pointer is inside the game screen.
#  *
#  * For multi-touch, the index variable can be used to successively query
#  * more presses.
#  * If index = 0 returns true for _PRESSED, coordinates can be extracted
#  * with _X, _Y for index = 0. One can then query _PRESSED, _X, _Y with
#  * index = 1, and so on.
#  * Eventually _PRESSED will return false for an index. No further presses
#  * are registered at this point. */
